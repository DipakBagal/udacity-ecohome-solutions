## 🗄️ Generated Files (Not in Repository)

The following files are **generated when you run the setup notebooks** and are excluded from git:

### SQLite Database
- **File:** `ecohome.db` (created in project root)
- **Generated by:** `01_db_setup.ipynb`
- **Contains:** 90 days of sample energy usage and solar generation data
- **Size:** ~50 KB

### ChromaDB Vector Store
- **Directory:** `chroma_db/` (created in project root)
- **Generated by:** `02_rag_setup.ipynb`
- **Contains:** Embedded knowledge base with OpenAI embeddings
- **Size:** ~5-10 MB

## 🚀 How to Generate These Files

### Step 1: Generate SQLite Database

```bash
jupyter notebook 01_db_setup.ipynb
```

Run all cells to create `ecohome.db` with:
- 90 days of energy usage data (HVAC, appliances, EV charging, etc.)
- 90 days of solar generation data (generation, self-consumption, exports, storage)

### Step 2: Generate Vector Store

```bash
jupyter notebook 02_rag_setup.ipynb
```

Run all cells to create `chroma_db/` directory with:
- Embeddings for all 7 knowledge base documents
- ~100-150 text chunks for RAG retrieval

## ❓ Why Aren't These in Git?

1. **Best Practice:** Don't commit generated/binary files to version control
2. **Size:** Database and vector store add 5-10 MB+ to repository
3. **Reproducibility:** Anyone can generate identical data by running the notebooks
4. **Security:** Databases might contain sensitive data in real deployments
5. **Flexibility:** Users can customize data generation parameters

## 🔒 Excluded by .gitignore

These patterns exclude database files:

```gitignore
# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3

# Vector store
chroma_db/
.chroma/
```

## 📝 Need Sample Data?

The notebooks generate realistic sample data:

- **Energy Usage:** Daily totals with breakdown by category (HVAC, appliances, EV, other)
- **Solar Generation:** Daily generation with self-consumption, export, and battery storage tracking
- **Realistic Patterns:** Seasonal variations, weather effects, weekday/weekend differences

## 🔄 Regenerating Data

To regenerate the databases:

1. Delete existing files:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   Remove-Item ecohome.db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force chroma_db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   
   # Mac/Linux
   rm -f ecohome.db
   rm -rf chroma_db/
   ```

2. Run setup notebooks again:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 01_db_setup.ipynb
   jupyter notebook 02_rag_setup.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ Verification

After running the notebooks, verify files exist:

```bash
# Check for database
ls ecohome.db

# Check for vector store
ls chroma_db/
```

You should see:
- `ecohome.db` - SQLite database file
- `chroma_db/` - Directory with ChromaDB files

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Knowledge base documents are ready (already in repo)
2. ⏭️ Run `01_db_setup.ipynb` to create database
3. ⏭️ Run `02_rag_setup.ipynb` to create vector store
4. ⏭️ Run `03_run_and_evaluate.ipynb` to test the agent

**Note:** The knowledge base documents in `documents/` **are included** in the repository and ready to use!
