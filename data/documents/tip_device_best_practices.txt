Device Best Practices for Energy Efficiency

Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Best Practices:
- Charge during off-peak hours (typically 10 PM - 6 AM) to take advantage of lower electricity rates
- Use solar power for charging whenever possible during daylight hours
- Set charge limits to 80% for daily use to extend battery life and reduce charging time
- Preheat or precool your EV while still plugged in to avoid draining the battery
- Use scheduled charging features to automatically charge during optimal times
- Consider level 2 charging (240V) for faster, more efficient charging at home

HVAC System Optimization:
- Set thermostats to 78°F in summer and 68°F in winter for optimal energy savings
- Use programmable thermostats to automatically adjust temperatures when away
- Maintain a 7-10°F setback for 8 hours can save up to 10% annually on heating and cooling
- Clean or replace HVAC filters monthly to maintain efficiency
- Schedule HVAC maintenance twice yearly (spring and fall)
- Use ceiling fans to circulate air and reduce HVAC load

Dishwasher Efficiency:
- Run only full loads to maximize energy efficiency
- Use eco or energy-saver modes which use less hot water
- Air dry dishes instead of heat drying to save 15-50% of energy per load
- Run during off-peak hours or when solar generation is high
- Scrape dishes instead of pre-rinsing to save water and energy
- Modern dishwashers use less water than hand washing

Washing Machine and Dryer:
- Wash clothes in cold water when possible - saves up to 90% of energy per load
- Run full loads but don't overload to ensure proper cleaning
- Use high spin speeds to extract more water before drying
- Clean dryer lint filter before each load
- Use moisture sensors on dryers to avoid over-drying
- Dry similar fabrics together for more efficient drying
- Consider air-drying clothes when weather permits

Pool Pump Optimization:
- Run pool pumps during off-peak hours or mid-day when solar is generating
- Use variable speed pumps which use 50-75% less energy
- Run pump for 6-8 hours daily in summer, 4-6 hours in winter
- Clean filters regularly to maintain pump efficiency
- Use a pool cover to reduce evaporation and maintain temperature
- Consider a timer to automate pump operation during optimal hours

Water Heater Efficiency:
- Set water heater to 120°F for optimal efficiency and safety
- Insulate water heater tank and hot water pipes
- Use low-flow fixtures to reduce hot water consumption
- Consider heat pump water heaters which are 2-3x more efficient
- Schedule hot water use during off-peak hours when possible
- Drain sediment from tank annually

Smart Home Device Integration:
- Use smart plugs to monitor and control energy usage of devices
- Set up automation rules to turn off devices when not in use
- Monitor standby power consumption and eliminate phantom loads
- Integrate devices with solar generation data for optimized operation
- Use occupancy sensors for lighting and HVAC control
- Schedule high-energy devices during periods of high solar generation
