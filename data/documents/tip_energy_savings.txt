General Energy Savings Tips and Strategies

Understanding Your Energy Bill:
- Peak hours typically 2 PM - 8 PM when electricity is most expensive
- Off-peak hours typically 10 PM - 6 AM with lowest rates
- Shoulder hours (mid-morning and late evening) have moderate rates
- Time-of-use (TOU) rates can vary by 2-3x between peak and off-peak
- Demand charges based on highest usage during billing period
- Fixed charges and delivery fees are constant regardless of usage

Solar Power Maximization:
- Peak solar generation typically occurs 10 AM - 2 PM
- Orient solar panels south for maximum year-round production
- Keep panels clean - dirt can reduce efficiency by 5-20%
- Monitor panel performance to detect issues early
- Use excess solar power during generation hours
- Consider battery storage to use solar power during peak rate hours
- Size solar system to match annual energy consumption
- Solar production varies by season - plan device usage accordingly

Load Shifting Strategies:
- Move high-energy tasks to off-peak or solar generation hours
- Pre-cool or pre-heat home before peak rate periods
- Charge electric vehicles overnight or during high solar generation
- Run dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers during off-peak times
- Use timers and smart plugs to automate load shifting
- Consider thermal mass storage (e.g., hot water) during low-rate periods

Seasonal Energy Management:
Summer Tips:
- Close blinds and curtains during hottest parts of day
- Use natural ventilation during cooler mornings and evenings
- Set AC temperature higher when away
- Use ceiling fans to make rooms feel 4-6°F cooler
- Grill outdoors to avoid heating the house
- Service AC before summer begins

Winter Tips:
- Let sunlight in during the day to naturally warm home
- Seal air leaks around windows and doors
- Use programmable thermostats to reduce heating when away
- Reverse ceiling fan direction to push warm air down
- Insulate attic and walls to prevent heat loss
- Service heating system before winter begins

Reducing Phantom Loads:
- Phantom loads account for 5-10% of residential electricity use
- Unplug chargers and devices when not in use
- Use smart power strips that cut power to idle devices
- Turn off computers and monitors completely rather than sleep mode
- Disable instant-on features on TVs and gaming consoles
- Unplug rarely used appliances

Behavioral Energy Savings:
- Turn off lights when leaving a room - saves 10-20% on lighting costs
- Use natural daylight whenever possible
- Take shorter showers to reduce water heating costs
- Don't leave refrigerator door open unnecessarily
- Defrost freezer regularly to maintain efficiency
- Cook multiple dishes at once to maximize oven use
- Use microwave or toaster oven for small meals instead of full oven

Appliance and Equipment Upgrades:
- ENERGY STAR appliances use 10-50% less energy
- LED bulbs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs
- Smart thermostats can save 10-23% on heating and cooling
- High-efficiency HVAC systems can save 20-40% on climate control
- Tankless water heaters are more efficient for low usage homes
- Variable speed pool pumps can save $300-500 annually
- Consider upgrade payback period when making decisions

Home Envelope Improvements:
- Proper insulation can reduce heating/cooling costs by 20-30%
- Air sealing prevents conditioned air from escaping
- Energy-efficient windows reduce heat transfer
- Weatherstripping doors and windows prevents drafts
- Insulate hot water pipes to reduce heat loss
- Add insulation to attic, walls, and basement
- Use door sweeps to block air leaks

Monitoring and Tracking:
- Install an energy monitoring system to track real-time usage
- Review monthly energy bills to identify trends
- Set energy reduction goals and track progress
- Compare usage year-over-year to measure improvements
- Use smart meters to understand hourly usage patterns
- Identify energy hogs and prioritize upgrades
- Benchmark your home against similar homes in your area

Financial Incentives and Programs:
- Utility rebates for energy-efficient appliances and upgrades
- Federal tax credits for solar, insulation, and HVAC improvements
- State and local incentive programs
- Net metering programs for solar panel owners
- Time-of-use rate plans to save money on off-peak usage
- Energy efficiency financing programs
- Demand response programs for grid support
